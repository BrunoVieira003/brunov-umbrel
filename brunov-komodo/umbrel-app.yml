  Komodo is a web app to provide structure for managing your servers, builds, deployments, and automated procedures.

  With Komodo you can:

  - Connect all of your servers, alert on CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage, and connect to shell sessions.

  - Create, start, stop, and restart Docker containers on the connected servers, view their status and logs, and connect to container shell.

  - Deploy docker compose stacks. The file can be defined in UI, or in a git repo, with auto deploy on git push.

  - Build application source into auto-versioned Docker images, auto built on webhook. Deploy single-use AWS instances for infinite capacity.

  - Manage repositories on connected servers, which can perform automation via scripting / webhooks.

  - Manage all your configuration / environment variables, with shared global variable and secret interpolation.

  - Keep a record of all the actions that are performed and by whom.
